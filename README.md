# Emotional_Twin

The Emotional Twin Model is an AI-powered system designed to mimic a person's emotional patterns, communication style, decision-making, and core values, functioning as a reflective, empathetic digital companion. It's part of the broader concept of digital legacy, personality simulation, and emotionally intelligent AI.

An Emotional Twin is a digital model that reflects and responds like you would — emotionally, linguistically, and psychologically — using NLP, sentiment analysis, memory graphs, and personal writing patterns.

Main Goals:

Mimic your emotional style — respond in your tone, style, and mindset.

Understand your mood and mental state through sentiment and emotion recognition.

Store emotional memories — remember how you felt or responded to situations.

Generate meaningful, personalized replies as if they came from your future self or emotional companion.
